## Extra Credit Opportunity

You may earn up to 10 extra credit points by writing up to 2 blog posts. Each blog post is worth 5 points. Details about the blog posts are [here](blog-assignment.md).

This opportunity is available to you if you completed either the paper or blog post assignment for the participation portion of the course.

If you were one of the handful of students who wrote a paper AND completed the blog posts, you need not do anything more. We will automatically take one or the other of these assignments and give you extra credit.

**Extra credit blog posts must be completed by FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 2016 at MIDNIGHT**
