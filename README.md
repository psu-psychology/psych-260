## Goals

There is perhaps no more fascinating scientific frontier than the study of the brain and behavior. The goal of this course is to introduce you to the principal methods, theories, and findings of the scientific fields that seek to open this frontier. At the end of the term, you will know more about the following topics:

- how the nervous system is structured and how it functions;
- how the nervous system evolved and develops; and
- how the nervous system influences behavior, thought, action, and emotion.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

It is your responsibility to maintain high standards of academic integrity. If you cheat on any assignment, copy the work of another student, or quote a published source without attribution, you may receive an F for the assignment or be subject to other penalties, as well. If you do not know what constitutes cheating or plagiarism, see the instructor or your TA.

### Late, missed or make-up assignments

#### Exams

Make-up exams may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview for graduate school or a job, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class.

If you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:

1. Contact the TA or the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the TA or instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.
2. Arrange with the TA or instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the TA's or the instructor's to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.

#### Quizzes

No make-up quizzes will be given. You may ask for a copy of the quiz for studying purposes, however.

#### Accommodation for persons with disabilities

The Pennsylvania State University encourages qualified persons with disabilities to participate in its programs and activities. If you anticipate needing any type of accommodation in this course or have questions about physical access, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.
