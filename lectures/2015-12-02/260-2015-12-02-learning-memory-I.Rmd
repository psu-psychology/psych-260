## Today's Topics

- Learning and memory

## Memory capacity of the human brain?

- 1e12 neurons
- 1e3 synapses/neuron
- 1e15 synapses or 1.25e14 bytes
- 1e9 gigabyte, 1e12 terabyte, 1e15 petabyte

## What is learning and memory anyway?

- Learning
    + ?
- Memory
    + ?
    
## How do you known when you've

- Learned?
- Remembered?

## What is learning and memory anyway?

- Learning
    + Change in perception, thought, behavior, emotion over time
- Memory
    + Information derived from past experience that influences current behavior
    
## Biological basis of L&M?

- Changes in patterns of neural activity
- Changes in patterns of connectivity
    + New synapses
    + Changes in synaptic strength (+/-)
    
## How do synapses change strength?

## Donald Hebb's Insight

*When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that Aâ€™s efficacy, as on of the cells firing B, is increased.* (Hebb, 1949, p. 62)

*Neurons that fire together wire together.* (Lowell & Singer, 1992, p. 211).

## NMDA receptor and *'Hebbian' learning*

- Coincidence detector
    + Sending cell has released NT
    + Receiving cell is/has been recently active
- Chemically-gated
    + Ligand- (glutamate + glycine co-factor) gated
- Voltage-gated
    + Mg++ ion 'plug' removed under depolarization

## NMDA receptors contribute to associative learning

- Associate (link)
    + Concept A -> Concept B
    + Neuron A -> Neuron B

## Long-term potentiation (LTP)

- Increase in synaptic strength based on recent activity.

## Spike-timing-dependent plasticity

- A before B: strengthen A->B
- A after B: weaken A->B
- [*Neural Plasticity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)
    + Lasting hanges in neural firing, connectivity
- NMDA receptor molecular mechanism for implementing LTP and spike-timing-dependent plasticity

## How does LTP work?

- Ca++ entry triggers biochemical cascade
- Existing (AMPA) glutamate receptors made to stay open longer
- New AMPA Glu receptors synthesized, inserted into postsynaptic membrane

## Dimensions of stored info

- Memory of what?
    + Facts/events/places vs. skills
- Memory of when?
    + Immediate vs. distant past
- Memory for how long?
    + Seconds vs. years

## Memory systems in the brain

## Main points

- Learning and memory involve changes in neural firing, circuitry
- Hebbian learning a type of associative learning
- NMDA receptor as coincidence detector
    + Molecular basis of one form of long-term potentiation (LTP)
- Different types of information stored in different brain systems

## Next time...

- The hippocampus
- Disorders of learning and memory
