## Announcements

- **Exam 1 on Tuesday**

## Today's Topics

- More on the action potential
- Exam 1 review

## Driving force and equilibrium potential

- "Driving Force" on a given ion depends on its equilibrium potential.
- Driving force larger if membrane potential far from equilibrium potential for ion.
- Equilibrium potential
    + Voltage that keeps current (inside/outside) concentrations the same
    + Voltage membrane potential will approach if **only** that ion flows

## [Equilibrium potentials calculated](http://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/nernst_potential_calculator.html) under typical conditions

| Ion | [inside]  | [outside]    | Voltage    |
|-----|-----------|--------------|------------|
| K+  | ~150 mM   | ~4 mM        | ~ -90 mV    |
| Na+ | ~10 mM    | ~140 mM      | ~ +55-60 mV |
| Cl- | ~10 mM    | ~110 mM      | - 65-80 mV  |


## AP propagation

- Propagation
    + move down axon, away from soma, toward axon terminals.
- Unmyelinated axon
    + Each segment "excites" the next

## AP propagation

- Myelinated axon
    + AP "jumps" between Nodes of Ranvier, *saltatory conduction*
    + Nodes of Ranvier == unmyelinated sections of axon
    + voltage-gated Na+, K+ channels exposed
    + Current flows through myelinated segments
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + **Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.**
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + **Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.**
    
## Conduction velocities

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## What happens when AP runs out of axon?

- Rapid change in voltage triggers neurotransmitter (NT) release
- Voltage-gated calcium Ca++ channels open
- Ca++ causes *synaptic vesicles* to bind with presynaptic membrane, merge
- NTs diffuse across *synaptic cleft*
- NTs bind with *receptors* on *postsynaptic membrane*
- NTs unbind, are inactivated
