## Today's Topics

- Wrap-up on NTs
- Hormonal communication

## Agonists vs. Antagonists

- *Agonists* 
    + bind to receptor
    + mimic action of endogenous chemical
- *Antagonists*
    + bind to receptor
    + block/impede action of endogenous chemical
    
## Valium is a GABA-A receptor agonist. This means:

1. It decreases inhibition
2. It activates a metabotropic Cl- channel 
3. It facilitates/increases inhibition
4. It blocks an ionotropic channel

## Valium is a GABA-A receptor agonist. This means:

1. It decreases inhibition
2. It activates a metabotropic Cl- channel
3. **It facilitates/increases inhibition**
4. It blocks an ionotropic channel

## Types of chemical communication

- *Neurocrine*
    + ￼Sending cell -> Receiving cell
- *Autocrine*
    + Sending cell -> itself
    + e.g., presynaptic autoreceptors
- *Paracrine*
    + Sending cell -> neighboring cells
    + NO and CO NTs
    
## Types of chemical communication

- *Endocrine*
    + Sending cell -> many cells elsewhere in body
- *Pheromone*
    + Sending cell -> other animals of same species
- *Allomone*
    + Sending cell -> cells in other species
    
## Hormones

- Chemical secreted into blood
- Act on specific target tissues
- Produce specific effects

## Can a substance be a hormone AND a neurotransmitter?

- Yes, why not?
- No, absolutely not.

## Can a substance be a hormone AND a neurotransmitter?

- **Yes, why not?**
- No, absolutely not.

- Examples
    + Melatonin
    + Epinephrine/adrenaline
    + Oxytocin
    + Vasopressin

## Behaviors under hormonal influence

- Ingestive (eating/ drinking)
    + ￼Fluid levels
    + Na, K, Ca levels 
    + Digestion
    + Blood glucose levels

## Behaviors under hormonal influence

- Reproduction
    + Sexual Maturation
    + Mating
    + Birth
    + Care giving

## Behaviors under hormonal influence

- ￼Responses to threat/ challenge
    + Metabolism
    + Heart rate, blood pressure 
    + Digestion
    + Arousal

## What do these behaviors have in common?

- Biological imperatives
- Proscribed in space and time
- Foraging/hunting
    + Find targets distributed in space, evaluate, act upon
- Often involve others

## Principles of hormonal action

- Gradual action
- Change intensity or probability of behavior 
- Behavior influences/influenced by hormones
    + +/- Feedback
- Multiple effects on different tissues

## Principles of hormonal action

- Produced in small amounts; released in bursts 
- Levels vary daily, seasonally
    + or are triggered by specific external/internal events
- Effect cellular metabolism 
- Influence only cells with receptors

## Differences between neural and hormonal communication

- Point to point vs.“broadcast”
    + Wider broadcast than neuromodulators
- Fast vs. slow-acting
- Short-acting vs. long-acting
- Digital (yes-no) vs. analog (graded) 
- Voluntary control vs. involuntary

## Similarities between neural and hormonal communication

- Chemical messengers stored for later release 
- Release follows stimulation
- Action depends on specific receptors
- 2nd messenger systems common

## Where are hormones released

<div class="centered">

</div>

## Where are hormones released?

- CNS
    + Hypothalamus
    + *Pituitary*
        * *Anterior*
        * *Posterior*
    + Pineal gland

## Where are hormones released

<div class="centered">
<img src="img/glands.jpg" height=450px>
</div>

## Where are hormones released?

- Rest of body
    + *Thyroid*
    +  *Adrenal (ad=adjacent, renal=kidney) gland*
        * *Adrenal cortex*
        * *Adrenal medulla*
    + *Gonads* (testes/ovaries)

## Two release systems 

- Direct
- Indirect

## Direct hormone release into bloodstream
    + Hypothalamus (paraventricular, supraoptic nucleus) to
    + Posterior pituitary
        * *Oxytocin*
        * *Arginine Vasopressin (AVP, vasopressin)*
        
## Direct release

</div>

## Indirect release

- Hypothalamus -> *releasing hormones* 
- Anterior pituitary -> *tropic hormones*
- End organs
    
## Indirect release

## Case studies

## Responses to threat or challenge

- Neural response
    + *Sympathetic Adrenal Medulla (SAM) response*
    + Sympathetic NS activation of adrenal medulla, other organs
    + Releases NE and Epi

## Responses to threat or challenge

- Endocrine response
    + *Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis*
    + Adrenal hormones released
- Hypothalamus
    + *Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH)*
- Anterior pituitary
    + *Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)*
    
## Responses to threat or challenge

- Adrenal cortex
    + *Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol)*
    + *Mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone)*

## ￼Adrenal hormones

- *Steroids*
    + Derived from cholesterol
- *Cortisol*
    + increases blood glucose, anti-inflammatory
    + negative consequences of prolonged exposure 
- *Aldosterone*
    + Regulates Na (and water) retention in kidneys

## Milk letdown reflex

- Hypothalamus releases oxytocin into posterior pituitary
- Targets milk ducts in breast tissue

## Oxytocin's role

- Sexual arousal
- Released in bursts during orgasm
- Stimulates uterine, vaginal contraction
- Links to social interaction, bonding
