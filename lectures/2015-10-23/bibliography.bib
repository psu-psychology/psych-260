	abstract = {Background: Previous research suggests that depressed individuals engage in prolonged elaborative processing of emotional information. A computational neural network model of emotional information processing suggests this process involves sustained amygdala activity in response to processing negative features of information. This study examined whether brain activity in response to emotional stimuli was sustained in depressed individuals, even following subsequent distracting stimuli.
Methods: Seven depressed and 10 never-depressed individuals were studied using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging during alternating 15-sec emotional processing (valence identification) and nonemotional processing (Sternberg memory) trials. Amygdala regions were traced on high-resolution structural scans and co-registered to the functional data. The time course of activity in these areas during emotional and nonemotional processing trials was examined.
Results: During emotional processing trials, never-depressed individuals displayed amygdalar responses to all stimuli, which decayed within 10 sec. In contrast, depressed individuals displayed sustained amygdala responses to negative words that lasted throughout the following nonemotional processing trials (25 sec later). The difference in sustained amygdala activity to negative and positive words was moderately related to self-reported rumination.
Conclusions: Results suggest that depression is associated with sustained activity in brain areas responsible for coding emotional features.},

	abstract = {Objective:  To study the predictive value of the Beck Suicide Intent Scale (SIS), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid for future early suicide in a group of high-risk male suicide attempters. Method:  Fifteen consecutive male suicide attempters admitted to a psychiatric ward at the Karolinska Hospital, who were not receiving any treatment with antidepressants were diagnosed according to DSM-III, assessed with SIS and BHS and submitted to lumbar puncture. All patients were followed up for cause of death. Results:  Five early suicides (within 2 years) were identified. Mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-HIAA differed between suicides and survivors. Low CSF 5-HIAA was identified in those who committed early suicide. Neither the Suicide Intent Score nor the Hopelessness Score distinguished suicides from survivors. Conclusion:  In high suicide risk hospitalized male psychiatric patients CSF 5-HIAA may be a better predictor of early suicide after attempted suicide than SIS or BHS.},

Studies have shown that cognitive therapy is as efficacious as antidepressant medication at treating depression, and it seems to reduce the risk of relapse even after its discontinuation. Cognitive therapy and antidepressant medication probably engage some similar neural mechanisms, as well as mechanisms that are distinctive to each. A precise specification of these mechanisms might one day be used to guide treatment selection and improve outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objective: A large number of studies with considerably variable methods have been performed to investigate brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. The aim of this study was to use a quantitative meta-analytic technique to synthesise the results of much of this research. Methods: Three separate quantitative meta-analytical studies were conducted using the Activation Likelihood Estimation technique. Analysis was performed on three types of studies: (1) those conducted at rest comparing brain activation in patients with depression and controls; (2) those involving brain changes following antidepressant treatment; and (3) those comparing brain activation patterns induced by the induction of positive or negative emotion in patients with depression compared with controls. Results: There appears to be a complex series of areas of the brain implicated in the pathophysiology of depression although limited overlap was found across imaging paradigms. This included a network of regions including frontal and temporal cortex as well as the insula and cerebellum that are hypoactive in depressed subjects and in which there is increase in activity with treatment. There was a corresponding set of subcortical and limbic regions in which opposite changes were found. Conclusions: There is limited overlap between the brain regions identified using differing imaging methods. The most consistently identified regions include areas of the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral, medial and inferior prefrontal cortex, insula, superior temporal gyrus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Further research is required to identify if different imaging methods are identifying complementary networks that are equally involved in the disorder. Hum Brain Mapp, 2008. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
