## Today's topic

- Measuring the speed of nervous system conduction
- And a tiny lesson in open, transparent, reproducible data science

## Scheme

- Speed = Distance/Time
- Chain of participants to make distance larger

## Condition 1 (ankle)

- Squeeze ankle
- ankle_shoulder + shoulder_brain + brain_decide + brain_shoulder + shoulder_hand

## Condition 2 (shoulder)

- Squeeze shoulder
- shoulder_brain + brain_decide + brain_shoulder + shoulder_hand
- Condition 1 - Condition 2
- ankle_shoulder + ~~shoulder_brain~~ + ~~brain_decide~~ + ~~brain_shoulder~~ + ~~shoulder_hand~~

## Measure

- sum(ankle_shoulder) for all participants -> Distance
- mean(time(Condition 1)) - mean(time(Condtion 2)) -> Time
- Speed = Distance/Time

## Materials

- Stop watch
- Tape measure

## Decisions

- Same hand or dominant?
- Alternate ankle/shoulder or one condition before the other?
- How many trials?
    + Fixed number?
    + When reach asymptote?
    
## Data files

- Data file with body measurements: [ankleshoulder.csv](ankleshoulder.csv)
    + participant, ankleshoulder (cm)
- Data file with reaction times: [time.csv](time.csv)
    + trial {1...n}, condition {ankle, shoulder}, time (s)

## Measuring distance

```{r}
distance = read.csv("ankleshoulder.csv", header = TRUE)

dist.hist = ggplot(data = distance, aes(x=ankleshoulder)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)
```

----

```{r measuring-distance, echo = FALSE}
dist.hist
```

## Sum distance

```{r}
with(distance, summary(ankleshoulder))

# Calculate sum
dist.sum = with(distance, sum(ankleshoulder))
```

The total distance is `r dist.sum` cm.

## Measuring time

```{r}
time = read.csv("time.csv", header=TRUE)

# load Gilmore's favorite plotting, analysis libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Plot data
time.plot = ggplot(data = time, aes(x=trial, y=time, color=condition)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

----

```{r measuring-time, echo = FALSE}
time.plot
```

## Calculate time difference

```{r}
time %>% filter(condition == "ankle") -> ankle.times
time %>% filter(condition == "shoulder") -> shoulder.times

time.diff = data_frame(trial=unique(time$trial), time=ankle.times$time - shoulder.times$time)

time.diff.plot = ggplot(data = time.diff, aes(x=trial, y=time)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

----

```{r condition-diff, echo = FALSE}
time.diff.plot
```

## Calculating speed

```{r}
time.diff$speed = dist.sum/time.diff$time

speed.hist = ggplot(data = time.diff, aes(x=speed)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)
```

---

```{r speed-summary, echo = FALSE}
speed.hist
```

## Plot time series of speeds

```{r plot-speed}
#speed.plot = ggplot(data = time.diff, aes())
```

## Summarizing findings

- We tested the mean speed of neural propagation in a sample of n=`r dim(distance)[1]` college-age adults.
- The mean speed of neural propagation over `r max(time.diff$trial)` trials was `r with(time.diff, summary(speed))['Mean']` cm/s with a range of [`r with(time.diff, summary(speed))['Min.']`, `r with(time.diff, summary(speed))['Max.']`] cm/s.
- These findings ARE/ARE NOT in accord with values we would expect from the literature.
