## Action potential

- Threshold of excitation
- Increase (rising phase/depolarization)
- Peak
    + at positive voltage
- Decline (falling phase/repolarization)
- Return to resting potential (refractory period)

## Action potential break-down

| Phase             | Neuron State |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Rise to threshold | + input makes membrane potential more + |
| Rising phase      | Voltage-gated Na+ channels open, Na+ enters |
| Peak              | Voltage-gated Na+ channels close and deactivate; voltage-gated K+ channels open |
| Falling phase     | K+ exits |
| Refractory period | Na+/K+ pump restores [Na+], [K+]; voltage-gated K+ channels close |

## Question

- During rising phase, Na+ enters because
    + Force of diffusion pushes Na+ in
    + Electrostatic force pushes Na+ in
    + Electrostatic force pushes K+ out

## Question

- During rising phase, Na+ enters because
    + **Force of diffusion pushes Na+ in**
    + **Electrostatic force pushes Na+ in**
    + Electrostatic force pushes K+ out
   
## Question

- Why does membrane potential go from - to +?
    + Na+ ions are +, inward flow makes interior more +
    + K+ ions are +, outward flow makes interior more +

## Question

- Why does membrane potential go from - to +?
    + **Na+ ions are +, inward flow makes interior more +**
    + K+ ions are +, outward flow makes interior more +
    
## Question

- During falling phase, K+ flows out of cell because
    + Force of diffusion pushes K+ out.
    + Force of diffusion keeps K+ in.
    + Electrostatic force pushes K+ out.
    + Electrostatic force keeps K+ in.
    
## Question

- During falling phase, K+ flows out of cell because
    + **Force of diffusion pushes K+ out.**
    + Force of diffusion keeps K+ in.
    + **Electrostatic force pushes K+ out.**
    + Electrostatic force keeps K+ in.
    
## Question

- At peak of action potential, why does electrostatic force push K+ out?
    + Membane potential is +, K+ repelled from interior
    + Membrane potential is -, K- attracted to interior
    
## Question

- At peak of action potential, why does electrostatic force push K+ out?
    + **Membane potential is +, K+ repelled from interior**
    + Membrane potential is -, K- attracted to interior
    
## Refractory periods

- Absolute
    + Cannot generate action potential (AP) no matter the size of the stimulus
    + Voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivated, reactivate in time.
- Relative
    + Can generate AP with larg(er) stimulus
    + Some voltage-gated K+ channels still open
- Refractory periods put 'spaces' between APs

## Generating APs

- Axon hillock
    + Portion of soma adjacent to axon
    + Integrates/sums input to soma
- Axon initial segment
    + Umyelinated portion of axon adjacent to soma
    + Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels exposed
    + If sum of input to soma > threshold, voltage-gated Na+ channels open

## AP propagation

- Propagation
    + move down axon, away from soma, toward axon terminals.
- Unmyelinated axon
    + Each segment "excites" the next
    
## AP propagation is like

## AP propagation

- Myelinated axon
    + AP "jumps" between Nodes of Ranvier, *saltatory conduction*
    + Nodes of Ranvier == unmyelinated sections of axon
    + voltage-gated Na+, K+ channels exposed
    + Current flows through myelinated segments
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + **Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.**
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + **Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.**
    
## Conduction velocities

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## What happens when AP runs out of axon?

- Rapid change in voltage triggers neurotransmitter (NT) release
- Voltage-gated calcium Ca++ channels open
- Ca++ causes *synaptic vesicles* to bind with presynaptic membrane, merge
- NTs diffuse across *synaptic cleft*
- NTs bind with *receptors* on *postsynaptic membrane*
- NTs unbind, are inactivated
