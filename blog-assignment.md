## Assignment

Create a blog at <http://sites.psu.edu> or add to an existing blog you have created.

Write at least two posts between now and **Friday, December 4, 2015 at 5:00 pm** that discuss different issues on any topic related to the biology of behavior. Your posts should be 1-3 paragraphs in length.

You may choose to comment on articles from the popular or scientific press. You may choose to discuss a topic we covered in class, perhaps how it might relate to you or to someone you know. The guidelines for the [paper option](paper-assignment.md) may be useful to you in drafting your posts. 

Be mindful of personal privacy. You should not reveal sensitive or personal information about yourself or another person in any way that could cause harm or embarrassment.

## Sources

You may use your textbook or other reference materials as resources. When mentioning a finding that appears in your textbook or another source, please cite the source using the APA Publication Manual format â€” e.g. (Gilmore & Cohen, 2003). If you use sources other than your textbook, provide a full bibliographic reference at the end of your paper. Wherever possible, link to articles or figures in your post so that others can follow what you've found.
